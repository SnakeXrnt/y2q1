  But she must have a prize herself you know said the Mouse

  If you knew Time as well as I do said the Hatter you

  Im afraid I dont know one said Alice rather alarmed at
  Im glad Ive seen that done thought Alice  Ive so often

  Im sure those are not the right words said poor Alice and
  Im very sorry youve been annoyed said Alice who was
  In THAT direction the Cat said waving its right paw round
  In another moment down went Alice after it never once
  In that case said the Dodo solemnly rising to its feet I
  Is that all said Alice swallowing down her anger as well as
  Is that the way YOU manage Alice asked
  It IS a long tail certainly said Alice looking down with
  It IS the same thing with you said the Hatter and here the
  It all came different the Mock Turtle repeated
  It began with the tea the Hatter replied
  It did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected
  It goes on you know the Hatter continued in this way
  It is a very good height indeed said the Caterpillar
  It is wrong from beginning to end said the Caterpillar
  It isnt directed at all said the White Rabbit in fact
  It isnt mine said the Hatter
  It isnt said the Caterpillar
  It matters a good deal to ME said Alice hastily but Im
  It must be a very pretty dance said Alice timidly
  It must have been that said the King unless it was
  It proves nothing of the sort said Alice  Why you dont
  It sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and
  It turned into a pig Alice quietly said just as if it had
  It was all very well to say Drink me but the wise little
  It was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded
  It was much pleasanter at home thought poor Alice when one
  It was no doubt  only Alice did not like to be told so
  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size
  It was the BEST butter the March Hare meekly replied
  It was the White Rabbit trotting slowly back again and
  It wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being
  Its a Cheshire cat said the Duchess and thats why
  Its a friend of minea Cheshire Cat said Alice  allow me
  Its a mineral I THINK said Alice
  Its a pun the King added in an offended tone and
  Its all about as curious as it can be said the Gryphon
  Its the first position in dancing Alice said but was
  Its the oldest rule in the book said the King
  Its the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from said the Queen
  Itsits a very fine day said a timid voice at her side
  Ive a right to think said Alice sharply for she was
  Ive had nothing yet Alice replied in an offended tone so
  Ive heard something like it said Alice
  Ive tried the roots of trees and Ive tried banks and Ive
  Just about as much right said the Duchess as pigs have to
  Just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a
  Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation which
  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall  in
  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a
  Keep your temper said the Caterpillar
  Last came a little feeble squeaking voice Thats Bill
  Lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of
  Leave off that screamed the Queen  You make me giddy
  Lets go on with the game the Queen said to Alice and Alice
  Luckily for Alice the little magic bottle had now had its full
  Mary Ann  Mary Ann said the voice  Fetch me my gloves
  May it please your Majesty said Two in a very humble tone
  Mine is a long and a sad tale said the Mouse turning to
  My name is Alice so please your Majesty said Alice very
  Nearly two miles high added the Queen
  Never mind said the King with an air of great relief
  Never said the Queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the
  Next came an angry voicethe RabbitsPat Pat  Where are

  No I give it up Alice replied  whats the answer
  No indeed said Alice  What sort of a dance is it
  No no  The adventures first said the Gryphon in an

  No please go on Alice said very humbly I wont interrupt
  No said Alice  I dont even know what a Mock Turtle is
  No said the Caterpillar
  No there were no tears  If youre going to turn into a pig
  No theyre not said the White Rabbit and thats the
  Nobody asked YOUR opinion said Alice
  Nonsense said Alice very loudly and decidedly and the
  Nor I said the March Hare
  Not I said the Lory hastily
  Not QUITE right Im afraid said Alice timidly some of the
  Not a bit said the Caterpillar
  Not at all said Alice  shes so extremely  Just then
  Not at first perhaps said the Hatter  but you could keep
  Not like cats cried the Mouse in a shrill passionate
  Not the same thing a bit said the Hatter  You might just
  Not yet not yet the Rabbit hastily interrupted  Theres
  Nothing WHATEVER persisted the King
  Nothing said Alice
  Nothing whatever said Alice
  Now I give you fair warning shouted the Queen stamping on
  Now tell me Pat whats that in the window
  Of course it is said the Duchess who seemed ready to agree
  Of course it was said the Mock Turtle
  Of course not Alice replied very readily  but thats
  Of course not said the Mock Turtle  why if a fish came
  Of course the Dodo replied very gravely  What else have
  Of course the Mock Turtle said  advance twice set to
  Of course they were said the Dormouse well in
  Of course twinkling begins with a T said the King sharply
  Of course you dont the Hatter said tossing his head
  Of the mushroom said the Caterpillar just as if she had
  Off with her head the Queen shouted at the top of her voice
  Oh I BEG your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great
  Oh I know exclaimed Alice who had not attended to this
  Oh Im not particular as to size Alice hastily replied
  Oh Ive had such a curious dream said Alice and she told
  Oh PLEASE mind what youre doing cried Alice jumping up
  Oh So Bills got to come down the chimney has he said
  Oh YOU sing said the Gryphon  Ive forgotten the words
  Oh a song please if the Mock Turtle would be so kind
  Oh as to the whiting said the Mock Turtle theyyouve
  Oh dont bother ME said the Duchess I never could abide
  Oh dont talk about trouble said the Duchess  I make you
  Oh theres no use in talking to him said Alice desperately
  Oh you cant help that said the Cat  were all mad here
  Oh you foolish Alice she answered herself  How can you
  Oh youre sure to do that said the Cat if you only walk
  On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and
  On which Seven looked up and said Thats right Five  Always
  Once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the
  Once said the Mock Turtle at last with a deep sigh I was
  Once upon a time there were three little sisters the
  One indeed said the Dormouse indignantly  However he
  One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked  This of course
  One side of WHAT  The other side of WHAT thought Alice to
  Only a thimble said Alice sadly
  Only mustard isnt a bird Alice remarked
  Pepper mostly said the cook
  Perhaps it doesnt understand English thought Alice I
  Perhaps it hasnt one Alice ventured to remark
  Perhaps not Alice cautiously replied  but I know I have to
  Please come back and finish your story Alice called after
  Please then said Alice how am I to get in
  Please would you tell me said Alice a little timidly for
  Please your Majesty said the Knave I didnt write it and
  Poor Alice  It was as much as she could do lying down on one
  Pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that
  Presently she began again  I wonder if I shall fall right
  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it
  Read them said the King
  Really now you ask me said Alice very much confused I
  Reeling and Writhing of course to begin with the Mock
  Repeat YOU ARE OLD FATHER WILLIAM said the Caterpillar
  Right as usual said the Duchess  what a clear way you
  Serpent I say again repeated the Pigeon but in a more
  Serpent screamed the Pigeon
  Seven flung down his brush and had just begun Well of all
  Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille the
  Shant said the cook
  She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself Which
  She boxed the Queens ears the Rabbit began  Alice gave a
  She cant explain it said the Gryphon hastily  Go on with
  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and
  She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the
  She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time and was a
  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice
  She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of
  She waited for some time without hearing anything more  at
  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but
  She was looking about for some way of escape and wondering
  Shes in prison the Queen said to the executioner  fetch
  Sixteenth added the Dormouse
  So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when
  So he did so he did said the Gryphon sighing in his turn
  So she called softly after it Mouse dear  Do come back
  So she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in
  So she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to
  So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake
  So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find
  So she was considering in her own mind as well as she could
  So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice every now
  So they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes  Alice
  So they went up to the Mock Turtle who looked at them with
  So they were said the Dormouse VERY ill
  So you did old fellow said the others
  Soles and eels of course the Gryphon replied rather
  Some of the jury wrote it down important and some
  Somebody said Alice whispered that its done by everybody
  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under
  Speak English said the Eaglet  I dont know the meaning of
  Stand up and repeat TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD said
  Stolen the King exclaimed turning to the jury who
  Stuff and nonsense said Alice loudly  The idea of having
  Stupid things Alice began in a loud indignant voice but
  Suddenly she came upon a little threelegged table all made of
  Suppose we change the subject the March Hare interrupted
  Sure it does yer honour  but its an arm for all that
  Sure its an arm yer honour  He pronounced it arrum
  Swim after them screamed the Gryphon
  THAT generally takes some time interrupted the Gryphon
  THAT you wont thought Alice and after waiting till she
  Take off your hat the King said to the Hatter
  Take some more tea the March Hare said to Alice very
  Talking of axes said the Duchess chop off her head
  Tell us a story said the March Hare
  Ten hours the first day said the Mock Turtle nine the
  Thank you its a very interesting dance to watch said
  Thank you said Alice its very interesting  I never knew
  That I cant remember said the Hatter
  That PROVES his guilt said the Queen
  That depends a good deal on where you want to get to said
  That is not said right said the Caterpillar
  That would be grand certainly said Alice thoughtfully
  Thats different from what I used to say when I was a child
  Thats enough about lessons the Gryphon interrupted in a
  Thats none of YOUR business Two said Seven
  Thats nothing to what I could say if I chose the Duchess
  Thats right shouted the Queen  Can you play croquet
  Thats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet
  Thats the reason theyre called lessons the Gryphon
  Thats very important the King said turning to the jury
  The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice  It looked good
  The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
  The Caterpillar was the first to speak
  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and
  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going
  The Dormouse is asleep again said the Hatter and he poured
  The Dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without
  The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes  I wasnt asleep he
  The Duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment
  The FishFootman began by producing from under his arm a great
  The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for
  The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise  What  Never
  The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes  then it watched the
  The Hatter looked at the March Hare who had followed him into
  The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all
  The Hatter shook his head mournfully  Not I he replied
  The Hatter was the first to break the silence  What day of
  The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when
  The King laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said
  The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit who said in a
  The King turned pale and shut his notebook hastily
  The Kings argument was that anything that had a head could be
  The Knave did so very carefully with one foot
  The Knave shook his head sadly  Do I look like it he said
  The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily  then
  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes
  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper
  The Mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on
  The Mouse only growled in reply
  The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great
  The Queen smiled and passed on
  The Queen turned angrily away from him and said to the Knave
  The Queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her
  The Queens argument was that if something wasnt done about
  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles  Where shall I begin
  The baby grunted again and Alice looked very anxiously into
  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her
  The door led right into a large kitchen which was full of
  The executioners argument was that you couldnt cut off a
  The first question of course was how to get dry again  they
  The first thing Ive got to do said Alice to herself as she
  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of There goes
  The first witness was the Hatter  He came in with a teacup in
  The games going on rather better now she said by way of
  The great question certainly was what  Alice looked all round
  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog
  The judge by the way was the King and as he wore his crown
  The jury all wrote down on their slates SHE doesnt believe
  The lobsters shouted the Gryphon with a bound into the air
  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried
  The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and breadandbutter
  The moment Alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to
  The next thing was to eat the comfits  this caused some noise
  The next witness was the Duchesss cook  She carried the
  The other guests had taken advantage of the Queens absence
  The players all played at once without waiting for turns
  The rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way
  The reason is said the Gryphon that they WOULD go with
  The soldiers were silent and looked at Alice as the question
  The table was a large one but the three were all crowded
  The trial cannot proceed said the King in a very grave
  The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates
  The twinkling of the what said the King
  Their heads are gone if it please your Majesty the soldiers
  Then it doesnt matter which way you go said the Cat
  Then it ought to be Number One said Alice
  Then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said Alice
  Then the Dormouse shall they both cried  Wake up
  Then the Queen left off quite out of breath and said to
  Then the words dont FIT you said the King looking round
  Then they all crowded round her once more while the Dodo
  Then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled
  Then you keep moving round I suppose said Alice
  Then you know the Mock Turtle went on you throw the
  Then you may SIT down the King replied
  Then you should say what you mean the March Hare went on
  Then you shouldnt talk said the Hatter
  There isnt any said the March Hare
  There might be some sense in your knocking the Footman went
  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she
  There was a dead silence instantly and Alice thought to
  There was a general clapping of hands at this  it was the
  There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear
  There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house
  There was certainly too much of it in the air  Even the
  There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that nor did Alice
  There were doors all round the hall but they were all locked
  Theres certainly too much pepper in that soup Alice said to
  Theres more evidence to come yet please your Majesty said
  Theres no sort of use in knocking said the Footman and
  Theres no such thing  Alice was beginning very angrily but
  These were the verses the White Rabbit read
  These words were followed by a very long silence broken only
  They all can said the Duchess and most of em do
  They couldnt have done that you know Alice gently
  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the
  They lived on treacle said the Dormouse after thinking a
  They very soon came upon a Gryphon lying fast asleep in the
  They were indeed a queerlooking party that assembled on the
  They were learning to draw the Dormouse went on yawning and
  They were obliged to have him with them the Mock Turtle
  Theyre putting down their names the Gryphon whispered in
  Thinking again the Duchess asked with another dig of her
  This answer so confused poor Alice that she let the Dormouse
  This did not seem to encourage the witness at all  he kept
  This here young lady said the Gryphon she wants for to
  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear  she got
  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape
  This sounded promising certainly  Alice turned and came back
  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party
  This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again
  This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation  Alice
  This was quite a new idea to Alice and she thought it over a
  This was such a new idea to Alice that she was quite silent
  Tis so said the Duchess  and the moral of that isOh
  To begin with said the Cat a dogs not mad  You grant
  Treacle said a sleepy voice behind her
  Treacle said the Dormouse without considering at all this
  Turn a somersault in the sea cried the Mock Turtle
  Tut tut child said the Duchess  Everythings got a
  Two days wrong sighed the Hatter  I told you butter
  Two lines cried the Mock Turtle  Seals turtles salmon
  UNimportant of course I meant the King hastily said and
  Ugh said the Lory with a shiver
  Very much indeed said Alice
  Very said Alice  wheres the Duchess
  Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice as she went hunting about
  Very true said the Duchess  flamingoes and mustard both
  Wake up Alice dear said her sister Why what a long
  We called him Tortoise because he taught us said the Mock
  We had the best of educationsin fact we went to school
  We indeed cried the Mouse who was trembling down to the end
  We must burn the house down said the Rabbits voice and
  Well  Ive often seen a cat without a grin thought Alice
  Well  WHAT are you said the Pigeon  I can see youre
  Well I cant show it you myself the Mock Turtle said  Im
  Well I never heard it before said the Mock Turtle but it
  Well I shant go at any rate said Alice  besides
  Well I should like to be a LITTLE larger sir if you
  Well Id hardly finished the first verse said the Hatter
  Well Ive tried to say HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE but it
  Well at any rate the Dormouse said the Hatter went on
  Well be off then said the Pigeon in a sulky tone as it
  Well if I must I must the King said with a melancholy
  Well it must be removed said the King very decidedly and
  Well its got no business there at any rate  go and take it
  Well perhaps not said Alice in a soothing tone  dont be
  Well perhaps you havent found it so yet said Alice but
  Well perhaps your feelings may be different said Alice
  Well then the Cat went on you see a dog growls when its
  Well then the Gryphon went on if you dont know what to
  Well there was Mystery the Mock Turtle replied counting
  Well thought Alice to herself after such a fall as this I
  What CAN all that green stuff be said Alice  And where
  What I was going to say said the Dodo in an offended tone
  What IS a Caucusrace said Alice not that she wanted much
  What IS the fun said Alice
  What IS the use of repeating all that stuff the Mock Turtle
  What a curious feeling said Alice I must be shutting up
  What a curious plan exclaimed Alice
  What a pity it wouldnt stay sighed the Lory as soon as it
  What did they draw said Alice quite forgetting her promise
  What did they live on said Alice who always took a great
  What do you know about this business the King said to
  What do you mean by that said the Caterpillar sternly
  What for said Alice
  What for said the one who had spoken first
  What size do you want to be it asked
  What trial is it Alice panted as she ran but the Gryphon
  What was THAT like said Alice
  What was that inquired Alice
  Whats in it said the Queen
  When IM a Duchess she said to herself not in a very
  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat she was surprised to
  When the procession came opposite to Alice they all stopped
  When we were little the Mock Turtle went on at last more
  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the
  Which is just the case with MINE said the Hatter
  Which would NOT be an advantage said Alice who felt very
  While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept
  Who ARE you talking to said the King going up to Alice and
  Who are YOU said the Caterpillar
  Who cares for you said Alice she had grown to her full
  Who is it directed to said one of the jurymen
  Whos making personal remarks now the Hatter asked
  Why SHE of course said the Dodo pointing to Alice with
  Why SHE said the Gryphon  Its all her fancy that  they
  Why did you call him Tortoise if he wasnt one Alice asked
  Why not said the March Hare
  Why said the Caterpillar
  Why said the Dodo the best way to explain it is to do it
  Why said the Gryphon you first form into a line along the
  Why should it muttered the Hatter  Does YOUR watch tell
  Why there they are said the King triumphantly pointing to
  Why what are YOUR shoes done with said the Gryphon  I
  Why with an M said Alice
  With extras asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously
  Would it be of any use now thought Alice to speak to this
  Would you like to see a little of it said the Mock Turtle
  Would you tell me said Alice a little timidly why you are
  Wouldnt it really said Alice in a tone of great surprise
  Write that down the King said to the jury and the jury
  YOUD better not talk said Five  I heard the Queen say only
  Yes I think youd better leave off said the Gryphon  and
  Yes but I grow at a reasonable pace said the Dormouse
  Yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the Hatter

  You may go said the King and the Hatter hurriedly left the
  You may not have lived much under the sea I havent
  You mean you cant take LESS said the Hatter  its very
  You might just as well say added the Dormouse who seemed to
  You might just as well say added the March Hare that I
  You must be said the Cat or you wouldnt have come here
  You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
  You ought to be ashamed of yourself said Alice a great
  You ought to have finished said the King  When did you
  You promised to tell me your history you know said Alice
  You said the Caterpillar contemptuously  Who are YOU
  You shant be beheaded said Alice and she put them into a
  You should learn not to make personal remarks Alice said
  Youll get used to it in time said the Caterpillar and it
  Youll see me there said the Cat and vanished
  Your hair wants cutting said the Hatter  He had been
  Youre a very poor speaker said the King
  Youre wrong about the crumbs said the Mock Turtle
  Youve no right to grow here said the Dormouse
  and just take his head off outside the Queen added to one

Alice again
Alice and she went on  Would you tell me please which way I
Alice and sighing
Alice began to say I once tasted but checked herself hastily
Alice called out as loud as she could If you do  Ill set
Alice could not stand and she went round the court and got
Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up
Alice feeling very glad that it was over at last  and I do so
Alice indignantly and she sat down in a large armchair at one
Alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their
Alice replied so eagerly that the Gryphon said in a rather
Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse
Alice to herself  Shy they seem to put everything upon Bill
Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry  No Ill look
Alice was only too glad to do so
Ambition Distraction Uglification and Derision
And as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter
And how do you know that youre mad
And she thought of herself I wish the creatures wouldnt be so
And then turning to the rosetree she went on What HAVE you
As she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door
Bill the Lizard could not make out at all what had become of
Bill then the Rabbits voice alongCatch him you by the
Bills got the otherBill fetch it here ladHere put em up
But do cats eat bats I wonder  And here Alice began to get
But everythings curious today  I think I may as well go in at
But the snail replied Too far too far and gave a look
Call the next witness  And he added in an undertone to the
Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and
Come and help me out of THIS  Sounds of more broken glass
Conqueror  For with all her knowledge of history Alice had
Consider my dear  she is only a child
Consider your verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling
Dear dear  How queer everything is today  And yesterday

Do you take me for a dunce  Go on
Dont be all day about it and he went on in these words
Dormouse  And they pinched it on both sides at once
Dormouse  Turn that Dormouse out of court  Suppress him  Pinch
Dormouse and repeated her question  Why did they live at the
Dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were Elsie
Dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep
Dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down
Dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two

Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was
Here Bill catch hold of this ropeWill the roof bearMind
Here the Dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep
How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about
How surprised hell be when he finds out who I am  But Id
However at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they
However she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so
I can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller I can creep
I cant take more
I could shut up like a telescope  I think I could if I only
I dont quite understand you she said as politely as she

Imagine her surprise when the White Rabbit read out at the top
In a little while however she again heard a little pattering of
In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its

It was the White Rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a

Queen Really my dear YOU must crossexamine the next witness
Queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his

a VERY unpleasant state of mind she turned away
a baby  altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at
a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant
a great deal to come before that
a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings
a little hot tea upon its nose
a little more conversation with her friend
a minute or two sobs choked his voice  Same as if he had a bone
a most extraordinary noise going on withina constant howling
a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in
a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when
a present of everything Ive said as yet
a real Turtle
a song
a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two
a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion and went
about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over
about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly
about the same height as herself and when she had looked under
about you  you must manage the best way you can but I must be
above her  then saying to herself This is Bill she gave one
across his eyes  He looked at Alice and tried to speak but for
added aloud
added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence
adding Youre looking for eggs I know THAT well enough and
addressing nobody in particular  Shed soon fetch it back
adventures
afraid of interrupting him Ill give him sixpence  I dont
afraid that it would be offended again
after all and I shall have to go and live in that poky little
after the birds  Why shell eat a little bird as soon as look
again
again
again
again
again  I dare say there may be ONE
again  The Mock Turtle went on
again and said So you think youre changed do you
again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as
again and we wont talk about cats or dogs either if you dont
again before its done
again so violently that she looked down into its face in some
again the cook had disappeared
again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the
again with a little shriek and went on  that begins with an
against each other however they got settled down in a minute or
against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being
air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till
alarm  This time there could be NO mistake about it  it was
all  But perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked
all I know is it would feel very queer to ME
all came different Alice replied in a very melancholy voice
all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice
all know whether it would like the name  however it only
all manner of thingseverything that begins with an M

all thy other queer noises would change she knew to the
all would change to dull realitythe grass would be only
almost anything you liked with the clock  For instance suppose
always HATED cats  nasty low vulgar things  Dont let me hear
am now  Thatll be a comfort one waynever to be an old woman
among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and
among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but
an hour or so and were quite dry again the Dodo suddenly called
an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking  No itll
and Alices first thought was that it might belong to one of the

and both creatures hid their faces in their paws
and called out to her in an angry tone Why Mary Ann what ARE

and down in an agony of terror  Oh there goes his PRECIOUS

and four times six is thirteen and four times seven isoh dear
and if the Queen was to find it out we should all have our heads
and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin  However she did not
and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again
and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know
and looked at her and the Queen said severely Who is this
and looked very uncomfortable
and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few
and night  You see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turn
and offer him the crown  Williams conduct at first was
and people began running about in all directions tumbling up
and punching him in the back  At last the Mock Turtle recovered
and put back into the jurybox or they would die
and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then Alice
and said No never so you can have no idea what a delightful
and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons
and she heard it muttering to itself The Duchess  The Duchess
and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish
and so on then when youve cleared all the jellyfish out of
and such things that make children sweettempered  I only wish
and that in about half no time  Take your choice
and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it  a
and the moral of THAT isTake care of the sense and the
and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden
and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon
and then Alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the
and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that Alice had not a
and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and
and there stood the Queen in front of them with her arms folded
and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was
and walking away  You insult me by talking such nonsense
and was going on shrinking rapidly  she soon found out that the
and went down on one knee  Im a poor man your Majesty he
and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that
and were resting in the shade  however the moment they saw her
and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the
and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again
and why it is you hateC and D she added in a whisper half
and would only say I am older than you and must know better

angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three
angry about it  And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah
angry and wags its tail when its pleased  Now I growl when Im
another  However Ive got back to my right size  the next
another minute there was not even room for this and she tried
answer questionsHow am I to get in she repeated aloud
anxious to have the experiment tried
anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad
anxiously round to make out who was talking
anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under
appearing and vanishing so suddenly  you make one quite giddy
are  Im never sure what Im going to be from one minute to
are gone from this side of the ground  So she tucked it away
are tarts made of
are the jurors  She said this last word two or three times over
arm that was linked into hers began to tremble  Alice looked up
around her became alive the strange creatures of her little
as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one
as he could go
as he spoke and added It isnt a letter after all  its a set
as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of
as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high
as she could do to hold it
as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so
as they came nearer Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart
as well
as well say that I see what I eat is the same thing as I eat
as you say it
asked
asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight
asked the Gryphon and the Gryphon answered very nearly in the
at HIS time of life
at it
at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth
at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning but I think
at this cornerNo tie em together firstthey dont reach half
attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the
away
away  She did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was
away even in the middle of her favourite word moral and the
away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it
back please  we dont want YOU with us
back to the croquetground
back to the little door  but alas the little door was shut
bankthe birds with draggled feathers the animals with their
barrowful will do to begin with

bats eat cats for you see as she couldnt answer either

behind him
behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it
behind them a railway station  However she soon made out that
being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing
being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and
believe theres an atom of meaning in it

brown hair  And itll fetch things when you throw them and
brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the
but a grin without a cat  Its the most curious thing I ever
but as the door opened inwards and Alices elbow was pressed
but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened
but it doesnt matter much thought Alice as all the arches
but it just missed her
but it makes rather a handsome pig I think  And she began
but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips  I know
but tea  I dont see any wine she remarked
but thenI shouldnt be hungry for it you know
but thenalways to have lessons to learn  Oh I shouldnt like
but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT
by an occasional exclamation of Hjckrrh from the Gryphon and
by mice and rabbits  I almost wish I hadnt gone down that

calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to
came near her she began in a low timid voice If you please
came skimming out straight at the Footmans head  it just
came the guests mostly Kings and Queens and among them Alice
cant get out at the doorI do wish I hadnt drunk quite so
cant have anything to put down yet before the trials begun
cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller I
cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer you
cant see you  She was moving them about as she spoke but no
cant swim can you he added turning to the Knave
capering wildly about
cards after all  I neednt be afraid of them
carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and
case I can go back by railway she said to herself  Alice had
catching mice you cant think  And oh I wish you could see her
caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded
cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtles
cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it
certain it must be really offended  We wont talk about her any
certainly was not here before said Alice and round the neck
changed for Mabel  Ill try and say How doth the little
checked herself hastily
child was very fond of pretending to be two people  But its no

considering how in the world she was to get out again
contemptuously  I dare say you never even spoke to Time
continued the King
conversation  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillars
conversation  While she was trying to fix on one the cook took
conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute
corner but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen  she found
could
could not possibly reach it  she could see it quite plainly
could think of nothing better to say than his first remark It
court without even waiting to put his shoes on
crashNow who did thatIt was Bill I fancyWhos to go
creatures  Alice led the way and the whole party swam to the
creatures argue  Its enough to drive one crazy
creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because
crept a little way out of the wood to listen
cried
croqueted the Queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when it
crumbs would all wash off in the sea  But they HAVE their tails

dears  Its high time you were all in bed  On various pretexts
decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for
decidedly and there was silence for some minutes
deepest contempt  Ive seen a good many little girls in my
delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she
did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly

difficult game indeed
digging her sharp little chin into Alices shoulder as she added
direction in which the March Hare was said to live  Ive seen
directions just like a starfish thought Alice  The poor
directions will look
disappeared so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and
dish of tarts upon it  they looked so good that it made Alice
dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could

distant green leaves

down upon her  she gave a little scream half of fright and half
dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the
dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream
drink something or other but the great question is what
dropped them I wonder  Alice guessed in a moment that it was

for a minute or two which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of

for instance theres the arch Ive got to go through next
for she had read several nice little histories about children who
for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and
for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether
for they havent got much evidence YET she said to herself
for this time the Mouse was bristling all over and she felt

get ready to play croquet with the Queen and she hurried out of

her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange
her to pass away the time
her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset
her violently with its wings
here  And the moral of that isThe more there is of mine the
here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs  She
here till Im somebody elsebut oh dear cried Alice with a
hers would in the aftertime be herself a grown woman and how
herself
herself
herself I wonder what they WILL do next  If they had any
herself as well as she could for sneezing
herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps
herself rather sharply I advise you to leave off this minute
herself to some tea and breadandbutter and then turned to the
hes perfectly idiotic  And she opened the door and went in
high enough yetOh theyll do well enough dont be particular
him  Off with his whiskers
him Tortoise
himself as he came Oh the Duchess the Duchess Oh wont she
himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and
his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice What
his first speech
his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on
history
hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it
honour at all at all  Do as I tell you you coward and at
hopeful tone though I wont have any pepper in my kitchen AT
hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking
hours I THINK or is it twelve  I
house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so
house of the March Hare  she thought it must be the right house
howled so that Alice could hardly hear the words
hurry  a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating
hurry to change the subject
idea came into her head  If I eat one of these cakes she
idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that
if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice
if youve seen them so often of course you know what theyre
impatient tone  explanations take such a dreadful time
impatiently  any shrimp could have told you that
important to say
in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more
in hand in couples  they were all ornamented with hearts  Next
in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt
in his throat said the Gryphon  and it set to work shaking him
in the lock and to her great delight it fitted
in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence  At
in their mouths and the reason is here the Mock Turtle
inches high
inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little
inside no one could possibly hear you  And certainly there was
instance if you were INSIDE you might knock and I could let
instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her
instantly made a memorandum of the fact
interest in questions of eating and drinking
interesting story but she could not help thinking there MUST be
interrupted if you dont explain it as you go on  Its by far
into Alices and they walked off together
into a tree
into her face
into its eyes again to see if there were any tears
into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight
into this they slipped the guineapig head first and then sat
invitation from the Queen to play croquet  The FrogFootman
invited said the March Hare
invited yet
is
is I suppose
is but I shall remember it in a bit
is it
is something comes at me like a Jackinthebox and up I goes
it
it  So she stood still where she was and waited
it advisable
it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her
it and the others all joined in chorus Yes please do but
it begins I passed by his garden
it busily painting them red  Alice thought this a very curious
it every now and then and holding it to his ear
it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song
it in less than no time shed have everybody executed all round
it is
it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on
it may kiss my hand if it likes
it off
it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like
it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have
it signifies much she said to herself I should think it
it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write
it so she turned to the Mock Turtle and said What else had you
it to halfpast one as long as you liked
it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself
it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question
it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
it were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin lessons
it would be as well to introduce some other subject of
itll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of thingsI
its face to see what was the matter with it  There could be no
its forehead the position in which you usually see Shakespeare
its getting  She was close behind it when she turned the
its hurry to get hold of it then Alice thinking it was very
its too bad that it is
itself Oh dear  Oh dear  I shall be late  when she thought
itself and was in the act of crawling away  besides all this
judge she said to herself because of his great wig
jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with
just been picked up
just begun to repeat it when a cry of The trials beginning
just possible it had fallen into a cucumberframe or something
keeping up the conversation a little
key and when she went back to the table for it she found she
kind to them thought Alice or perhaps they wont walk the
knee and looking at them with one eye I seem to see some
know
know and he says its so useful its worth a hundred pounds
know how to begin  For you see so many outoftheway things
know what it means
know your history she do
knowand then after that into a butterfly I should think youll
knowledge  Just think of what work it would make with the day
labelled ORANGE MARMALADE but to her great disappointment it
large eyes full of tears but said nothing
large flowerpot that stood near  The three soldiers wandered
last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a
last remark its a vegetable  It doesnt look like one but it
last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in
last the Dodo said EVERYBODY has won and all must have
last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle Drive on old fellow
later
lay the blame on others
leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to
leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself
learn lessons in here  Why theres hardly room for YOU and no
least one of them  In another minute the whole head appeared
leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon  Alice did not quite like
legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had
less there is of yours
lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a VERY good
lessons thought Alice I might as well be at school at once
letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to
like
like a serpent  She had just succeeded in curving it down into a
like a skyrocket
like a telescope
like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember
like being that person Ill come up  if not Ill stay down
like having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting every
like that  He got behind Alice as he spoke
like that curious song about the whiting
like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and
like them  When the Mouse heard this it turned round and swam
like then  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is
like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could
like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand
like what I get is the same thing as I get what I like
listen to her still it was good practice to say it over yes
little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures till she too began
little before she made her next remark  Then the eleventh day
little glass table  Now Ill manage better this time she
little of the righthand bit to try the effect  the next moment
little passage  and THENshe found herself at last in the
little scream of laughter  Oh hush the Rabbit whispered in a
little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear
little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it
little use as it left no mark on the slate
little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was  at
lives a Hatter  and in THAT direction waving the other paw
lives a March Hare  Visit either you like  theyre both mad
long enough
long ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and Im
look at the Queen who was reading the list of singers
look over their slates but it doesnt matter a bit she
looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw
looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised
looked at poor Alice who felt ready to sink into the earth  At
looked round eager to see the Queen
looking across the garden called out The Queen  The Queen
looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something
looking anxiously about her  Oh do let me help to undo it
looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too  but the
looking as solemn as she could
looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity and this was
looking at the Cats head with great curiosity
looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she
loving heart of her childhood  and how she would gather about
low voice Why the fact is you see Miss this here ought to
low voice Your Majesty must crossexamine THIS witness
made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in
made her so savage when they met in the kitchen
makes people hottempered she went on very much pleased at
making faces at him as he spoke
making quite a commotion in the pool as it went
making such VERY short remarks and she drew herself up and said
managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit
manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without
many lessons to learn  No Ive made up my mind about it if Im
many teathings are put out here she asked
many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect
marched off after the others
mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was
master though  He was an old crab HE was
matter worse  You MUST have meant some mischief or else youd
me  Theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great
me see  that would be four thousand miles down I think for
me seehow IS it to be managed  I suppose I ought to eat or
mean what makes them so shiny
meaning in them after all  SAID I COULD NOT SWIM you
meaning of it at all  However jurymen would have done just
melancholy tone  Nobody seems to like her down here and Im
melancholy words
messages for a rabbit  I suppose Dinahll be sending me on
messages next  And she began fancying the sort of thing that
minding their own business
minute or two
minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as
minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen
moderate  But the insolence of his Normans  How are you
moment  she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her
moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she
moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water  He first
moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle
moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself
moments delay would cost them their lives
month and doesnt tell what oclock it is
moral if only you can find it  And she squeezed herself up
more if youd rather not
more simplyNever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than
more the shriek of the Gryphon the squeaking of the Lizards
more to be said
more to come so she sat still and said nothing
morning  I almost think I can remember feeling a little
mouse  Everything is so outoftheway down here that I should
mousea mouseO mouse  The Mouse looked at her rather
mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice
mouth and its great eyes half shut
mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself  Then it got
mouth enough for it to speak with
move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more
much
much the most interesting and perhaps as this is May it wont be
must be thought Alice  I wonder what theyll do next  As for
must have been a holiday
my dear said Alice seriously Ill have nothing more to do
my elbow
my head would go through thought poor Alice it would be of
narrow to be sure but I THINK I can kick a little
natured she thought  still it had VERY long claws and a great
nearly carried it off
nearly forgotten to ask
nearly getting up and saying Thank you sir for your
neighbour to tell him  A nice muddle their slatesll be in
neighbouring poolshe could hear the rattle of the teacups as
neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be
never
never do to ask  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere
never executes nobody you know  Come on
never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked
never had to do such a thing before and he wasnt going to begin
never happened and now here I am in the middle of one  There
never to lose YOUR temper  Hold your tongue Ma said the
next and so on
nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her faceand
no more of it appeared
no sorrow you know  Come on
no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened  So she
nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very
not  So she went in search of her hedgehog
not becoming
not in that ridiculous fashion  And he got up very sulkily
not looking for eggs as it happens and if I was I shouldnt
not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself
noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves
noticing her  Then followed the Knave of Hearts carrying the
nowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have changed since her
of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on
of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the
of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and
of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious
of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a White
of her or of anything else
of his shrill little voice the name Alice
of his tail  As if I would talk on such a subject  Our family
of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest  Edwin and
of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards
of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went
of mixed flavour of cherrytart custard pineapple roast
of the bottle was a paper label with the words DRINK ME
of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding
of the officers  but the Hatter was out of sight before the
of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and
of the sort
of them with the other  the only difficulty was that her
of verses
of which was a bright brass plate with the name W RABBIT
off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour
off into a doze but on being pinched by the Hatter it woke up
off the subjects on his flappers Mystery ancient and modern
offended tone Hm No accounting for tastes  Sing her Turtle
offended you know
officer could get to the door
officers of the court and I never understood what it meant
oh she knows such a very little  Besides SHES she and Im I
on  But why did they live at the bottom of a well
on going into the garden at once but alas for poor Alice when
on that theyd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering
on the bank and of having nothing to do  once or twice she had
on their slates and she could even make out that one of them
on without attending to her if we had the door between us  For
once  And in she went
one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her
one for catching miceoh I beg your pardon cried Alice again
one hand and a piece of breadandbutter in the other  I beg
one of the officers of the court Bring me the list of the
one place on
only answered Come on and ran the faster while more and more
only one doesnt like changing so often you know
only one who got any advantage from the change  and Alice was a
only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook
open place with a little house in it about four feet high
opening its eyes Of course of course just what I was going to
opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to
or Longitude Ive got to  Alice had no idea what Latitude was
or Longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to
or kettle had been broken to pieces
or small  Off with his head she said without even looking
or so there were no arches left and all the players except the
or soand what with the breadandbutter getting so thinand
or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves  she took up the fan and
ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the
other  In the very middle of the court was a table with a large
other  he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to
other arm curled round her head  Still she went on growing and
other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle
others looked round also and all of them bowed low
ought to be a book written about me that there ought  And when
ought to go from here
ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything
out The race is over and they all crowded round it panting
out a history of the accident all except the Lizard who seemed
out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it
out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy
out the FishFootman was gone and the other was sitting on the
out when they saw Alice coming  Theres PLENTY of room said
over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy
over the verses to himself  WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE thats
over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he
own children
painting those roses
pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the
pardon your Majesty he began for bringing these in  but I
particular at least if there are nobody attends to themand
partners
passage not much larger than a rathole  she knelt down and
patience of an oyster
peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no
people about like that
people knew that  then they wouldnt be so stingy about it you
people that walk with their heads downward  The Antipathies I
pepperbox in her hand and Alice guessed who it was even before
perhaps he cant help it she said to herself his eyes are so
person
picked her way through the wood  Its the stupidest teaparty I
pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book
pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very
pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right
plates and dishes  The Duchess took no notice of them even when
please your Majesty he asked
pleased and wag my tail when Im angry  Therefore Im mad
pocked till she was about a foot high  then she walked down the
pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare it was at the
poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or
politely  Did you speak
politely but she added to herself Why theyre only a pack of
politely for I cant understand it myself to begin with and
politely if I had it written down  but I cant quite follow it
poor animals feelings  I quite forgot you didnt like cats
prettier
prizes
procession wondering very much what would happen next
pulling me out of the window I only wish they COULD  Im sure I
put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again
puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing
puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was  she was
quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in
quarrelling with the other players and shouting Off with his
queerest thing about it  The jury all looked puzzled
question  What sort of people live about here
question added the Gryphon and then they both sat silent and
question it didnt much matter which way she put it  She felt
quicker
quiet till she got to the part about her repeating YOU ARE OLD
quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice
quite a long argument with the Lory who at last turned sulky
quite absurd for her to carry it further
quite hungry to look at themI wish theyd get the trial done
quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed
quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with
rabbitholeand yetand yetits rather curious you know
ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been
ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a
rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit
rather late and the Queen said
rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of
rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face
raving madat least not so mad as it was in March  As she said
read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that
read in the newspapers at the end of trials There was some
really Im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing
reason to be afraid of it
recognised the White Rabbit  it was talking in a hurried nervous
reedsthe rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep
remark myself
remarked  because they lessen from day to day
remarked theyd have been ill
remarking as it went One side will make you grow taller and
remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day
remembering her own childlife and the happy summer days
repeated in a wondering tone
repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the
repeating his remark with variations  I shall sit here he
replied in a pleased tone
replied rather shyly II hardly know sir just at present
reply
reply for fear they should forget them before the end of the
result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the
rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the
ring with the Mouse in the middle  Alice kept her eyes
room at all for any lessonbooks
roses  Off with their heads and the procession moved on
roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at
round
round on its axis
rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew
running out of the woodshe considered him to be a footman
rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the

said Alice
said Alice a little timidly  but its no use going back to
said Aliceand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster
said in a hoarse feeble voice  I heard every word you fellows
said on and off for days and days
said the Gryphon
said the Gryphon half to itself half to Alice
said the King rubbing his hands so now let the jury
said the Lory
said the March Hare
said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and
same thing as I sleep when I breathe
same words as before Its all his fancy that  he hasnt got
sang this very slowly and sadly
saw mine coming
say
say as it turned a corner Oh my ears and whiskers how late
say in my life
say it out loud
say to itself Then Ill go round and get in at the window
saying and the words came very queer indeed
saying to her daughter Ah my dear  Let this be a lesson to you
school in the sea  The master was an old Turtlewe used to call
screaming with passion  She had already heard her sentence three
seashore
see after some executions I have ordered and she walked off
see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and
see it trot away quietly into the wood  If it had grown up
see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness
see the Mock Turtle and to hear his history  I must go back and
see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which
seem sending presents to ones own feet  And how odd the
seem to dry me at all
seemed not to be listening so she went on again  Twentyfour
seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay
seen in her brothers Latin Grammar A mouseof a mouseto a

seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so
sense theyd take the roof off  After a minute or two they

settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her
settled down again into its nest  Alice crouched down among the
severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered
shall get on better
shall have somebody to talk to
shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs  How brave theyll
shaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all
sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next
sharp little chin
she comes to  At this moment Five who had been anxiously
she could
she could not even get her head though the doorway and even if
she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in
she felt a violent blow underneath her chin  it had struck her
she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking
she first saw the White Rabbit  She was a little nervous about
she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she
she got into the court by the way the people near the door began
she got to the door she found he had forgotten the little golden
she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once
she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having
she is such a nice soft thing to nurseand shes such a capital
she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking so
she knew the name of nearly everything there  Thats the
she noticed that the Queen was close behind her listening  so
she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that
she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child
she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly  the
she stopped hastily for the White Rabbit cried out Silence in
she thought and hand round the refreshments  But there seemed
she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she
she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine
she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to
she went on likely to win that its hardly worth while
she would have called him a fishand rapped loudly at the door
she would keep through all her riper years the simple and

sight hurrying down it  There was not a moment to be lost
silence
silence  at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys
simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the
sing
singers in the last concert on which the wretched Hatter
singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a

sisters dream
sitting next to her  I can hardly breathe
size by this time  Youre nothing but a pack of cards
size for going though the little door into that lovely garden
slatepencil and the choking of the suppressed guineapigs
sleep youve had
slowly after it  I never was so ordered about in all my life
slowly back to her  its face was quite pale with passion Alice
slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the
smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering
smoke from one end to the other  the Duchess was sitting on a
sneezing all at once
sneezing and howling alternately without a moments pause  The
so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not
so much about a whiting before
so proud as all that
so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out
so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much
soldiers did  After these came the royal children there were
solemnly
solemnly presented the thimble saying We beg your acceptance of
solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key
some book but I dont remember where
some of the other birds tittered audibly
some of them were animals and some were birds I suppose they
some while in silence
somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she
something now  Tell her to begin  He looked at the Gryphon as
soon make you dry enough  They all sat down at once in a large
soon submitted to by the English who wanted leaders and had been
sorrowful tone Im afraid Ive offended it again  For the
sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more
sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close
sounded best
sounds of broken glass  What a number of cucumberframes there
sounds uncommon nonsense
sounds will take care of themselves
sourand camomile that makes them bitterandand barleysugar
speak first why your cat grins like that
speech they all cheered
splashing paint over me like that
spoke
spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air  She did not
stairs  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and
stamping about and shouting Off with his head or Off with
stand on their hands and feet to make the arches
stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped
stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long
sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over
still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place
still running on the song Id have said to the porpoise Keep
story for yourself
strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do
stupid
subdued tone and added with a kind of sob Ive tried every
subject
subject of conversation  Are youare you fondofof dogs
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height
such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you
such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or
sudden burst of tears I do wish they WOULD put their heads
sulkily remarked If you cant be civil youd better finish the
sun  IF you dont know what a Gryphon is look at the picture
suppose
suppose by being drowned in my own tears  That WILL be a queer
suppressed by the officers of the court  As that is rather a
sure I cant be Mabel for I know all sorts of things and she
sure shes the best cat in the world  Oh my dear Dinah  I
surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good
surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbits little
swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and
tails in their mouthsand theyre all over crumbs
take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the
taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave
talking over its head  Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse
taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on
taught Laughing and Grief they used to say
teacup instead of the breadandbutter
teatime and weve no time to wash the things between whiles
telescopes  this time she found a little bottle on it which
telling me next that you never tasted an egg
tells us a story
ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand
than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for
that
that for two reasons  First because Im on the same side of the
that he said to the Gryphon
that her idea of the tale was something like this
that isBe what you would seem to beor if youd like it put
that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a
that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the
that loose slateOh its coming down  Heads below a loud
that must be what he did with the tarts you know
that she began shrinking directly  As soon as she was small
that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it
that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without
that she thought  I must be growing small again  She got up
that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she
that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the Rabbit
that the Mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to
that the mouse doesnt get out  Only I dont think Alice went
thatched with fur  It was so large a house that she did not
thats about the right distancebut then I wonder what Latitude
thats not a regular rule  you invented it just now
the Cat
the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off
the Duck  its generally a frog or a worm  The question is
the Gryphon
the Hatter and the March Hare went Sh sh and the Dormouse
the Knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on
the March Hare and his friends shared their neverending meal
the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little
the Pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as I was
the White Rabbit interrupted  UNimportant your Majesty means
the White Rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has
the air  This time there were TWO little shrieks and more
the back  However it was over at last and they sat down again
the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently
the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work
the circumstances  There was a large mushroom growing near her
the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle  Alice was very
the court and the King put on his spectacles and looked
the court arminarm with the Dormouse  Fourteenth of March I
the court with a smile  There was a dead silence
the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads
the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the
the fifth bend I think
the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight
the fireirons came first then followed a shower of saucepans
the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off
the jury of course I GAVE HER ONE THEY GAVE HIM TWO why
the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of
the little door had vanished completely
the lobsters to the dance  So they got thrown out to sea  So
the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would

the month is it he said turning to Alice  he had taken his
the most confusing thing I ever heard
the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large

the next verse
the night  Let me think  was I the same when I got up this
the other saying in a solemn tone For the Duchess  An
the other side will make you grow shorter
the pleasure of making a daisychain would be worth the trouble
the proposal
the room  The cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went out
the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool
the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and
the sentence first
the shore and then Ill tell you my history and youll
the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in
the table  she opened it and found in it a very small cake on
the tarts on the table  Nothing can be clearer than THAT
the treacle from
the twinkling of the tea
the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice as
the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyesand
the way
the week before
the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped
the world am I  Ah THATS the great puzzle  And she began
their faces  There was a sound of many footsteps and Alice
their friends had taught them  such as that a redhot poker
their mouths  So they couldnt get them out again  Thats all
them
them  However on the second time round she came upon a low
them as if she had known them all her life  Indeed she had
them called out Sit down all of you and listen to me  ILL
then said It was a treaclewell
then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself
then theyre a kind of serpent thats all I can say
then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows
thenBills to go downHere Bill the master says youre to
there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
theres an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to
theres half my plan done now  How puzzling all these changes
theres hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable
theres nothing written on the OUTSIDE  He unfolded the paper
they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone
they arrived with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts
they cant prove I did  theres no name signed at the end
they had to fall a long way  So they got their tails fast in
they had to pinch it to make it stop
they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it
they hurried back to the game the Queen merely remarking that a

they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her
they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs
they would call after her  the last time she saw them they were
theyve begun asking riddlesI believe I can guess that she

thing a Lobster Quadrille is
thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up
thing is to get into that beautiful gardenhow IS that to be
thing said the Duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately
thing to be sure  However everything is queer today
things I used to know  Let me see  four times five is twelve
things all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules
things indeed were really impossible
things went on just as usual  I wonder if Ive been changed in
think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
think it was he said
think of any good reason and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in
think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble
think she was rather glad there WAS no one listening this
think very likely it can talk  at any rate theres no harm in
thinking I should be free of them at last they must needs come
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age
thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as
this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short
this for it might end you know said Alice to herself in my
this moment  Then came a little pattering of feet on the
this pool  I am very tired of swimming about here O Mouse
this she looked up and there was the Cat again sitting on a
this sort of life  I do wonder what CAN have happened to me
this way  Stop this moment I tell you  But she went on all
those serpents  Theres no pleasing them
though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed
thought Alice Well I hardly knowNo more thank ye Im
thought Alice only as its asleep I suppose it doesnt mind
thought Alice without pictures or conversation
thought and it said in a low trembling voice Let us get to
thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon
thought its sure to make SOME change in my size and as it
thought to herself
thought to herself I dont see how he can EVEN finish if he
thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had
thoughtfully  I should like to hear her try and repeat
three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the
three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate
threelegged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was
through the air  Do you think you could manage it  And what
through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the
through was more hopeless than ever  she sat down and began to
throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby
tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its

till you come to the end  then stop

time  Off with his head
time as it didnt sound at all the right word but I shall
time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it
time but never ONE with such a neck as that  No no  Youre a
tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes
tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and
tis love tis love that makes the world go round
to Alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke  I must go and
to ME and told me he was going a journey I should say With
to be a letter written by the prisoner toto somebody
to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about
to curtsey as she spokefancy CURTSEYING as youre falling
to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth
to do with this creature when I get it home when it grunted
to everything that Alice said theres a large mustardmine near
to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction
to herself being rather proud of it  for she thought and
to introduce it
to kill it in a day or two  wouldnt it be murder to leave it
to know but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY
to learn
to make out exactly what they said
to move  She soon got it out again and put it right not that
to play croquet
to queer things happening  While she was looking at the place
to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and
to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort
to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on
to them she heard one of them say Look out now Five  Dont go
to them to be otherwise
together
together
together at one corner of it  No room  No room they cried
tone  And the Gryphon added Come lets hear some of YOUR
tone  sit down both of you and dont speak a word till Ive
too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open
too stiff  And the Gryphon never learnt it
took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was
tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing
trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled
trees upon her face
trembled so that he shook both his shoes off
trembling voice and I hadnt begun my teanot above a week
trial
trickling down his face as long as it lasted
tried hedges the Pigeon went on without attending to her but
triumphantly
true
truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as
trying  So she began  O Mouse do you know the way out of
trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game
trying to explain the mistake it had made
trying to find her way out  I shall be punished for it now I
trying to invent something
trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot
turkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finished
turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright
turning to Alice she went on Whats your name child
twinkled after thatonly the March Hare said
two and the game began  Alice thought she had never seen such a

two three and away but they began running when they liked

uncomfortable
under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for
under the door so either way Ill get into the garden and I
understand why it is I hate cats and dogs
undoing itself she carried it out into the open air  IF I
unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered
unimportant  Alice could see this as she was near enough to
unimportantimportant as if he were trying which word
unlocking the door that led into the garden  Then she went to
untwist it  After a while she remembered that she still held the

up in great disgust and walked off the Dormouse fell asleep
up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door

upon them THIS size  why I should frighten them out of their
upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann
use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished
use now thought poor Alice to pretend to be two people  Why
use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at
ventured to ask
very cautiously  But I dont understand  Where did they draw
very decided tone  tell her something about the games now
very goodnaturedly began hunting about for them but they were
very gravely I think you ought to tell me who YOU are first
very little use without my shoulders  Oh how I wish
very much ifif Id only been the right size to do it  Oh

whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a

which the words EAT ME were beautifully marked in currants
which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep

with Seaography  then Drawlingthe Drawlingmaster was an old
with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen
with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the
with his knuckles  It was opened by another footman in livery
with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of
with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very

with some severity its very rude
with the Queen today
with the birds and animals that had fallen into it  there were a

with you  Mind now  The poor little thing sobbed again or
witness
wits  So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did
wonder at the Mouses tail but why do you call it sad  And
wonder how many miles Ive fallen by this time she said aloud
wonder if I shall ever see you any more  And here poor Alice
wonder is that theres any one left alive
wonder what was going to happen next  First she tried to look
wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural
wondering how she was ever to get out again
wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came
words a little From the Queen  An invitation for the Duchess
words have got altered
work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her
world of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any  And
would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other
would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing
would break  She pitied him deeply  What is his sorrow she
would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she
would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand
would happen  Miss Alice  Come here directly and get ready
wouldnt mind said Alice  three inches is such a wretched
wouldnt suit the works he added looking angrily at the March
wouldnt talk about wasting IT  Its HIM
wrapping itself up very carefully remarking I really must be
wriggling down from the sky  Ugh Serpent
writing in his notebook cackled out Silence and read out
writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no
writingdesks which wasnt much
written to nobody which isnt usual you know
yawned and shut his eyesTell her about the reason and all
yawning  Im getting tired of this  I vote the young lady
yesterday because I was a different person then
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded
yet I dont know he went on spreading out the verses on his
yet had any dispute with the Queen but she knew that it might

you got in your pocket he went on turning to Alice
you know you say things are much of a muchnessdid you ever
you might catch a bat and thats very like a mouse you know
you out you know  He was looking up into the sky all the time
you see Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her
you what year it is
youd only have to whisper a hint to Time and round goes the
young Crab a little snappishly  Youre enough to try the
your pardon cried Alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the
your shoes and stockings for you now dears  Im sure I shant
youre growing too
