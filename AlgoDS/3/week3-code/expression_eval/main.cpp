        Write a program that reads an expression that consists of positive integers, parentheses, and
        the operators +, * and % (modulo) from standard input, and evaluates the expression.

        On each side of an operator you will either find an integer or a parenthesized expression,
        so there is no need to consider operator precedence.

        Example input: ((1 + 2) * (3 + 4)) % 11
        Example output: 10

        Hint: Create a stringstream from the input line, and pass it to a recursive function
        that evaluates the expression and returns the result.
