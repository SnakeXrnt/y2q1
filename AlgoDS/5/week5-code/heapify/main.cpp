        Write a program that reads an array from its standard input, given as an array between
        square brackets (e.g. `[1,3,5,7,9]` - see week 1), and prints the number of *swaps* that
        would be performed when turning this array into a valid binary *min-heap* using
        the `std::make_heap` function from the C++ Standard Library.

        You can't use the `std::make_heap` function directly, instead you must implement the
        heapify algorithm as described in the lecture, and count the number of swaps performed
        during the process.

        The time complexity of your solution must be O(n), where n is the number of elements
        in the input array.

        Example input:
            [1, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 7]
        output:
            2
