        Write a program that reads a binary *min-heap* from its standard input, given as an array,
        and an integer that represents a value to be removed from the heap.

        The program must remove the specified value from the heap while maintaining the heap
        property, and print the resulting heap in the same format as the input. If the value
        is not present in the heap, the program must print the original heap unchanged.

        Example input:
            [3, 4, 10, 23, 50, 90] 50
        Example output:
            [3, 4, 10, 23, 90]
