        Write a program that reads two binary search trees from standard input, which represent sets of
        integers (no duplicates within each tree), and checks if the first one is a subset of the second one.

        The program must output "true" if the first tree is a subset of the second one, and "false" otherwise.

        The time complexity of your program must be O(n + m), where n and m are the sizes of the two trees.
