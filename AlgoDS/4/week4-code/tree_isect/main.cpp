        Write a program that reads two binary search trees from standard input, which represent sets of
        integers (no duplicates within each tree), and builds a vector containing the intersection of the two sets.

        The program must write the resulting vector to standard output.

        The time complexity of your program must be O(n + m), where n and m are the sizes of the two trees.

        Example input:
            ((2 3 4) 5 (6 7 8)) (3 5 10)
        Example output:
            [3, 5]
