        each dependency `(A,B)` indicates that task A must be completed before task B
        can be started.

        completed, or `CYCLE` if no such order exists (i.e., if there is a cycle in the
        dependencies).

        If a valid order exists, it must be printed as a comma-separated list between
        square brackets (e.g. `[A,B,C]`).
